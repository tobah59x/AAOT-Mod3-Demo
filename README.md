# AAOT-Mod3-Demo
### Demo for Agentic AI Module 3 assignment

The files you need to run any of the code:
- The .env should contain your Discord token and API key. Right now it's set up to work with the Groq version of the code, but you can edit as needed. THIS SHOULD NOT BE MADE PUBLIC.
- The requirements.txt file lists the modules that need to be installed on your system before you run the code. This is also configured to run the Groq version of the code. To use another version of the code, check the requirements.txt file for the author (see the comment at the top of the code).
- The version of the code you want to use. The current setup is for running discord-groq.py

Feel free to message me via the course inbox if you have questions or suggestions.
